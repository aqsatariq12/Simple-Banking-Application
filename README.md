This is a basic console-based Banking Application written in Java. The program allows users to perform common banking operations such as depositing money, withdrawing funds, checking their account balance, and viewing account details.

Features:

2) Withdraw Funds:    Enables the user to withdraw money from their account, subject to sufficient balance.
3) Check Balance:     Displays the current balance of the user's account.
4) Account Details:   Shows the userâ€™s account details, including account number and other relevant information.
5) Input Validation:  Ensures that only valid operations are selected and performed.
   
How It Works:
The application prompts the user to enter their choice of operation (Deposit, Withdraw, Check Balance, Account Details).
After selecting the operation, the corresponding function is executed.
Users can continue performing transactions until they choose to exit the application.

Technologies Used:
1) Java: Core programming language used to build the application.
2) Scanner Class: Used for capturing user input from the console.
3) Basic Object-Oriented Principles: Classes and objects are used to represent banking operations and customer details.
